Csn
===
Zend Framework 2 Module Common for All Cns Modules.

### What is Csn? ###

Csn is a common library for all other Csn modules. It extends Zend classes, overrides some methods etc. 
If such thing needs to be done more than once in in different modules in the same way that means it needs to be moved here.
